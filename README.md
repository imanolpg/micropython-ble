# MicroPython BLE example
Example of a BLE server in MicroPython. I have used the ESP32 microcontroller.

## Steps
1. Download MicroPython firmware for your board from https://micropython.org/download.
2. (Optional, easy way) Install Thonny IDE https://thonny.org/.
3. Connect the ESP32 to your computer.
4. Install the downloaded firmware in the ESP32. If you have installed Thonny follow this tutorial https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-thonny-micropython-python-ide-esp32-esp8266/. If you have not, follow this one https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/how-to-install-micropython-on-an-esp32.html.
5. Once the firmware is installed you can now upload python code to the ESP32.
